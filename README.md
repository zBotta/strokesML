# strokesML
A machine learning project for the strokes data set

## Code

### Deployment script

The ```main.py``` script makes a ML pipeline on the Stroke data set by using *sklearn* with *python*.

### Jupyter Notebook

The main script contains only the deployment of the ML pipeline, we are going to skip the data analysis part with all its graphics, as it is better to 
show it in the Jupyter Notebook.

The jupyter notebook with all the logic and analysis followed, can be found in the ```root/notebook``` folder.

## Data

The strokes data is found in the ```root/data``` folder
