# strokesML
A machine learning project for the strokes data set

## Code

The ```StrokesML.py``` script makes a ML pipeline on the Stroke data set by using *sklearn* with *python*.
For this "deployment script", we are going to skip the data analysis part with all its graphics, as it is better to 
show it in the Jupyter Notebook.

The jupyter notebook with all the logic followed, can be found in the ```root/data``` folder.

The strokes data is found in the ```root/data``` folder
